                    <p>I&#39;ve been in a couple of smaller groups online.
                        Mostly through discord. One of the most impactful small
                        server I&#39;ve been in was called </p>

                    <p>it started in 2018 as a way for my friends in Upward
                        Bound to talk during the rest of the year. UB was some
                        silly college prep program, it helped definitely and is
                        probably one of the reasons I&#39;m here today. <em>Probably</em>.
                        Anyway, we&#39;d post funny memes and videos and life
                        updates and things, play games together and sometimes
                        have jackbox nights! when it was populated it was quite
                        fun, over time friends added friends of friends and our
                        numbers got into the mid 30s <strong><em>small</em></strong>
                        very small. It&#39;s been inactive for about 3 years
                        now, the last message was posted In early 2021. I hope
                        everyone in there is doing ok at college/ whatever they
                        have gotten up to.. </p>
                    <p>This tildeverse server space in my Social Software class
                        reminded me of that discord server. </p>

                    <p>There is a huge difference between our server and any
                        other platform and that is the <em>GUIs</em>.</p>
                    <h3 id="however">however</h3>
                    <p>GUIs can be very closely emulated in bash environments
                        now.
                        For example w3m lets you browse the web and with
                        sufficient addons you can listen to music and see
                        images. It&#39;s got it all but the style sheet!! You
                        can play games with each other, you can see status
                        messages, direct message. The server&#39;s got it all.
                        Maybe even voice call? Does that exist? I feel like it
                        would. </p>
                    <p>Hello this is future lex: <a
                            href="https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/45529/terminal-based-voip-over-lan-on-linux">it
                            exists!</a> this stackexchange question has some
                        answers with different ways to voip using the terminal!
                        very cool!</p>
                    <p>there are some fun programs installed on the class server
                        and I&#39;ve been hopping in and out at my leisure to
                        play or look.</p>
                    <p>only once I saw someone else online, GET ONLINE PEOPLE!</p>
                    <p>my favorite program is advenure, it&#39;s from a package
                        called BSDgames. I&#39;m not quite sure what I&#39;m
                        doing but I&#39;m doing it! </p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/adventure.png">
                    <p>some of the more useful ones like w3m are cool but
                        impractical compared to their GUI counterpart. I did my
                        reading assignments using w3m, I think with a more
                        modern terminal browser I would have been satisfied but
                        it was just plain text and links, no font formatting or
                        anything else. it got the job done.

                    <p>That&#39;s not my terminal, it&#39;s from my
                        partner&#39;s mac. If I remember I&#39;ll take a
                        screenshot of <em>my</em> terminal it looks very cool!
