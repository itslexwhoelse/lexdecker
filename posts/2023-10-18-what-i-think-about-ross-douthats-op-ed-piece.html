      <p>It&#39;s hard to make a strong argument on the ethics of allowing children on social media. I should be more clear. It&#39;s hard to make <em>any</em> argument on the ethics of social media. Social media is such an unkempt beast, It&#39;s influence touches the lives of about half the population of the <strong>EARTH</strong>. Every other person alive has social media in some way, and that&#39;s scary.</p>
      <p>It&#39;s scary for an 11 year old to have access to the collective knowledge of billions of people in their pocket. They can find anything on there, <em>and they do</em>. Something interesting, something sad, something lewd, something hateful, something informative, something entertaining, something malicious. </p>
      <p>The way large social media companies have been run the last 20 years or so is increasingly more invasive and addictive. It&#39;s not good for developing minds. Or any minds really. But what&#39;s going to stop the chug of these massive cash machines? People like using them so why would they stop? </p>
      <p>I think Douthat&#39;s prescription would alleviate <em>some</em> adolescent struggles but due to the way every adolescent ever is many would slip through the systems that keep them out. That begs the question: Were the systems in place intentionally made to be so easy to bypass? I sure think so. More users, more engagement, more money.</p>
      <p>There&#39;s such a societal pressure to <em>have</em> social media. You have to have it. If you don&#39;t you&#39;ll be left out, you&#39;ll be uninformed. It&#39;s so easy to sign up, why don&#39;t you have it? Why is that? Was that the intention of these apps all along? Why are there so many ads about things I&#39;ve only said out loud?</p>
      <p>I think social media could have been great but it just feels too, fake. It&#39;s so inhuman and unnatural and discomforting. It&#39;s so informative and exciting and collaborative. It&#39;s so</p>
      <p>Scary.</p>
