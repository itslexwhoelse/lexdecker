      <p>Social media is addictive and manipulative. It is designed to keep you hooked. Its algorithms watch what you interact with and subtly change your feed to keep you hooked. This may not work on everyone but it works on the majority of people and that’s what these sites are counting on. I think we can fix social media but I don’t think we will. Sure it’s better for society but a more ethical, less addictive social media will put less money into the pockets of silicon valley. From what I've seen, specifically with Facebook, it has morphed from its original intention. Maybe originally it was made to be a small network connecting college students, then families and friends, then friends of friends, then celebrities, etc. But it has morphed into this digital pit of clicks. Anything to keep the viewer engaged, a funny post, an interesting ad, fun animations when you interact. It’s hard to describe what Facebook has become because it’s kind of everything, it’s a marketplace, a chatroom, a metaverse. It’s become a digital empire.

        <p>But it’s not irredeemable.</p>
        
        <p>It is unfortunate what has been happening to large social media sites recently. The downfall of Twitter, the commodification of Facebook, even Reddit’s api pricewall. With recent events it might pave a new path for decentralized social media to make a comeback.</p>
        
        <p>Personally I like the genuinity of webrings, they feel more interactive and interesting. Sure I can look up something on google but the act of finding the information feels much more rewarding and fun. It also is a great way to find interesting things you would never find on google. My favorite webring right now is <a href="https://gossipsweb.net">Gossips Web.</a>. We discussed it in class and
