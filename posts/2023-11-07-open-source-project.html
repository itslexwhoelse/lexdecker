<h2 id="-this-https-github-com-lakatrazz-bonelab-fusion-"><a href="https://github.com/Lakatrazz/BONELAB-Fusion">This</a></h2>
<p>is BONELAB-Fusion.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a mod for a virtual reality physics sandbox called BONELAB that adds multiplayer capabilities. It takes physics objects, player data, (and a bunch of other stuff) and syncs it with another player over WIFI.</p>
<p>there&#39;s no way to contribute because they already have a solid team working on it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Lakatrazz/BONELAB-Fusion/pull/41">KitchenBoy08 made a pull request to add some new features to the mod</a> it would let you filter lobbies by their options, like if someone wanted to filter out pure vanilla lobbies or modded lobbies or lobbies with pvp, etc. and a feature to sort lobbies by Steam friends.</p>
<p>The issues section is filled with a random assortment of questions, with no format and no convention for submitting </p>

<p>A modder by the name <a href="https://github.com/Lakatrazz">Lakatrazz</a> started creating this mod alone and over time they picked out a group of developers and friends to work on this project with them </p>

<p>This project is a sort of in-between. It started on October 5th, 2022. it originally used Discord&#39;s networking feature to invite players to their sessions but Discord got rid of that feature so now it uses Steam.</p>
<p>looking at the commits, this project was started in GitLab but moved to GitHub. That&#39;s where most of the work now comes from. it&#39;s mostly written in C#. Contributors have no expectations but they are only pulled when the code works and is helpful</p>
<p>some questions I have on this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are environments set up where you can use assets from a game (SDK development)</li>
<li>In the absence of sdk. <em>how????</em></li>
<li>what even is an Sdk?</li>
</ul>
<p>if I were to contribute to this project I&#39;m confident I could figure out a menu system. maybe. there already is one but this is purely hypothetical.</p>
