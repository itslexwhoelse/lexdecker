# hello! 
Try out the various installed programs on our tilde server. Navigate through the file system. Chat with others. Use finger to view other users.

Our social-software tilde server is a smaller area for social software and social media. You may also have experience with social software serving a smaller community: a family text group or a Discord server for a group of friends playing a game for example.

On your class blog you set up on your student server space, add a post about ‘small’ shared social networks:

Write about at least one of these smaller groups that you are a part of, including who is in the group, how long it has existed, how new people are invited into the ‘space’, and what is shared there.
Write about some of the differences between using a ‘platform’ and our open shared computer server. The most obvious difference is using a GUI vs text user interface, so if you describe that, add new information that is not immediately obvious.
Try out at least 3 programs on the server and write about using them separately. For each one, describe its purpose, how you used it, and its strength or limitations as a program. You are also welcome to include info on how it could be improved as well.


# a post about small shared social networks:
I've been in a couple of smaller groups online. Mostly through discord. One of the most impactful small server I've been in was called 
#### "Papa Don's pizzeria"  
it started in 2018 as a way for my friends in Upward Bound to talk during the rest of the year. UB was some silly college prep program, it helped definitely and is probably one of the reasons I'm here today. *probably*. anyway we'd post funny memes and videos and life updates and things, play games together and sometimes have jackbox nights! when it was populated it was quite fun, over time friends added friends of friends and our numbers got into the mid 30s ***small*** very small. it's been inactive for about 3 years now, the last message was posted in early 2021. I hope everyone in there is doing ok at college/ whatever they have gotten up to.. 

This tildeverse server space in my Social Software class reminded me of that discord server.

There is a huge difference between our server and any other platform and that is the GUIs but other than that I feel like server spaces have more to them than Discord servers. 

There are games and stuff
